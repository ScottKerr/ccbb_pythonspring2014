If you're on Ubuntu, skip steps 1-3 and do sudo apt-get install python-pip.

###First:

Download [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html)

###Second:

Move the get-pip.py file out of downloads and somewhere where you can run it (such as your home directory)

###Third

In your terminal, type:

```python
python get-pip.py
```

###Fourth:

Close the terminal and open a new window. This will ensure pip is functioning.

###Fifth
Type:

```UNIX
pip install -U ggplot
```

Now we're good to go.
